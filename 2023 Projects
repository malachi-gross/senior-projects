I am good friends with Greg Walsh, the lead designer at the firm, and I'm also familiar with two other designers, Suzanne and Greta. To expand on what I mean by interning, I will give examples of tasks I would do while working at the design firm. Going to IMS to visit all of the showrooms where different material samples are housed is one example of a task I'd be given. Ordering samples and connecting with couriers are two other examples. Something else that I'd do is sit in on client meetings and learn about how they are conducted. Organizing around the office is another example of a task I'd do. All of these tasks aim to familiarize me with local designers and companies in the field as well as the intricacies of designing homes. Greg and I have a close relationship, and I would be able to work with him closely on projects and put in my opinions on things. The word ""intern"" brings to mind people bossed around and tasked with getting coffee for the higher-ups—this isn't what my experience will be. My opinion is valued, and I'll essentially work like all the other designers, just not paid. I want to be a designer when I am older, and this internship will help me inversion what my future could look like, and also I can put it on my resume.","Here’s Greg’s description from his website. “Greg Walsh, Proprietor and Senior Interior Designer, has worked in the industry for nearly 28 years. Specializing in architectural detailing and design, he aims to create interiors that are as functional as they are beautiful. Greg oversees all MartinPatrick3 Studio projects and directs design and buying for the retail operations.” Greg also had his design firm before starting MartinPatrick3, and in a way, he is already a mentor to me. Over the summer, I took college classes on interior design, and I was able to share some of the designs I created in that class with him. He was invested in my designs—this greatly represents his educational abilities and personality.",greg@martinpatrick3.com,612-987-2000,,"I will go over to the north loop in Minneapolis where Martinpatrick3 is located and will start my day with a morning meeting with the rest of the design team. Greg and Suzanne, the two leaders, overview the week on monday and on the other days of the week they go over projects that they are all working on. Typically there's site visits that happen throughout the day and I go on those and during the times that there aren't site visits I would  help organize samples, return samples, help design projects, order samples, sit in on client meetings, order furniture, or help the designers with things they need me to do.

3/14/2023 23:54:11,23solvejpg@students.spa.edu,23solvejpg@students.spa.edu,Solvej,Graff,kivory@spa.edu,"My position at Way Cool Cooking School (WCCS) in Eden Prairie is like a skillfully decorated cake. The frosting and other flourishes are evident on the surface, but the actual substance is found beneath what is tasteful to the eyes. There is a rich chocolate cake veiled by all that.  In this metaphor, the frosting is the surface-level opportunity. Working with Way Cool Cooking School will no doubt promote my development in the kitchen as I continue to learn all that I can in the culinary arts and sciences. Plus, I would be doing so under the guidance of professionals in the field. Every recipe is different, offering its own opportunities and challenges. What better place to do this than WCCS, as I have done before in their classes.   	 However, the true center of it all is layers of decadent cake. My cake in May will be all the development to be had not only in the cooking part itself but also in the social nature of the activity. As a mentee, I will become more accustomed to collaborative work in a professional setting, a vital skill in any workplace environment. Additionally, when classes are held, I look to become more confident as a table instructor when leading one of the breakout groups during lessons. It is these social skills and others like them that will be advanced throughout the project.","     Mary Matthews (known to me as simply Chef Mary) joined the team at Way Cool Cooking School the year after she received her Bachelors in Culinary Management back in 2011. Since then she has become a vital part of the company. Her linked-in page describes her as ""responsible for implementing and following the culinary and unique business standards and overseeing the culinary operations of the Way Cool Cooking School."" 
     Though there is nothing which attests to her fitness to mentor me better than the many hours I spent at Way Cool throughout my childhood. Since I can remember I spent multiple weeks over my summers at Way Cool participating in their summer camp programs. Which is how I know Chef Mary. She and the other staff at Way Cool are the ones who taught me my way around the kitchen and it was there that I found my passion for confectionery. Both in group lessons and private cooking tutoring I have found Chef Mary to be an exceptional Chef as well as an enthusiastic teacher who is eager to share her passion with others of all ages.",mary@waycoolcookingschool.com,(952) 949-6799,,"Depending on what sort of classes are held that day and what day of the week it is the tasks will vary. Generally my duties will include set up around lunch time (eg. making sure all necessary ingredients are available, helping to make the example dish, setting materials on tables, etc.), class time (e.g. being a table assistent for a group in a class, mess management, demonstrator, and helper for ""hand raised"" moments), and wrap up (e.g. clean up and next day prep work). This is a rough estimate based on what I have observed as a summer program lil' chef.",Not applicable,"The process of arranging details is slightly delayed since my mentor was on vacation until 3/13. But I spoke to Chef Mary on the phone on 3/14 she said she was eager to get to work on coming up with a course of action. She is going to speak with the owner of Way Cool Cooking School, Ron, to confirm he is on board, but I don't believe there will be any issues. In May, Way Cool offers adult classes, kids-afterschool programs, family classes, corporate team building, and kids' birthday parties. While each class may be relatively short (1.5 to 3 hours each), plenty are offered over the week. Kids' birthday parties, for instance, run for 1.5 hours each, with a half hour between each for staff to reset things and about an hour for set up/clean up before and after the day. Seven of these parties run each weekend, so that is already 16 hours. That, combined with assisting in other classes during the week and prep work (e.g., making example cakes, making Kowalskis runs, doing dishes, portioning out ingredients, and doing more dishes), should be plenty to get to the 20-hour minimum. Chef Mary said she would get back to me with more about a preliminary agenda/schedule later this week, and I can pass those details on upon request.","Parisa, Alyssa, and I are planning to volunteer together at Open Arms, which is an organization that provides food and meals for people who are critically ill.
