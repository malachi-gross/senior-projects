I applied for economics and/or data science at many of my prospective colleges, so this area of study is directly related to my potential career path. My research will be a statistical analysis of professional hockey goaltenders, a natural extension of a personal project I have been independently working on for a few months. My existing project explored MN high school hockey goaltenders using publicly available data; my new research will allow a more in-depth analysis, due to the greater wealth of statistics provided by professional hockey leagues and the presence of my mentor, Dr. Lisa Giddings. Dr. Giddings has discussed with me the possibility of exploring the difference in ability between female goaltenders in the PWHL and men in the NHL. Female goaltenders consistently post higher save percentages than the men, and Dr. Giddings is interested in working with me to determine if this reflects a significant skill difference, or if the discrepancy can be attributed to lower levels of competition in the PWHL. If this project does not fully occupy the time commitment necessitated by the Senior Project, I will move on to different areas of research. By the end of the capstone, it is likely I will have constructed an informal research paper on this topic. This will be bolstered by the knowledge I have gained from the AP Stats class I am currently taking.
